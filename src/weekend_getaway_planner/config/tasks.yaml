    Then build a detailed 2-day weekend itinerary (Friday evening to Sunday evening is ok).
    Include morning/afternoon/evening blocks, specific activities, meal ideas,
    approximate timings, and how each part ties to the user's interests.
  expected_output: >

    - Food & drinks
    - Activities / entry fees
    - Misc (tips, souvenirs, etc.)
    Compare against the stated {budget} range.

  expected_output: >
    Clear cost breakdown table or bullets + total estimate.
    Final verdict: Fits budget / Slightly over (with fixes) / Significantly over (recommend different destination).
